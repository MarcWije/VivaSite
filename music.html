                <h2>1. Life in Technicolor</h2>
                <p>The opening track of <i>Viva La Vida</i> begins with a slow fade into a sample of Jon Hopkins' <i>Light Through the Veins</i> before breaking into a riff played on a tabla and santoor. The rest of the band gradually joins in, culminating in a joyous "oh oh oh" part at the end, as the band is renowned for.<br><br> But perhaps the most important function of this track is to set the tone of the album, that wonderfully exuberant, warm feeling that pervades throughout even the most anguished moments of the album. It also serves to showcase how much Coldplay can really achieve, even without Martin's iconic vocals.</p>

                <h2>2. Cemeteries of London</h2>
                <p>The first track with vocals on the album, <i>Cemeteries of London</i> sounds unlike anything the band has done before. Eerie and atmospheric, it paints a picture of wanderings among the dead of London, with odd timings and claps pushing the song along. Jonny's guitar work really shines through here, with riffs cutting through the rest of the instruments right before the climatic final verse. <br><br>Thematically, the track seems to serve as a vague introduction to our protagonists, who evidently are fond of gallavanting through graveyards at night. But why must they do this? We shall find out. </p>

                <h2>3. Lost!</h2>
                <p>The third track on the album doesn't really need to add the exclamation point to its title, as the song itself manages to underscore the message it shares with melodramatic pipe organ, and drumming that numerous publications have referred to as "african-inspired". <i>Lost!</i> is a defiant anthem, the underdog's explanation for his lack of victory. <br><br> In the context of the album, it has an interesting addition to the story. Here, although never officially confirmed, is where the story of Viva La Vida begins. Our protagonists (Let's call them Chris, Violet, and.. hmmm.. Thom) are all defiant young adults, antagonistic and cynical of the world, railing at the big fish. Their world is populated by the many citizens of their small kingdom, which is evidently not doing well at the hands of the current monarch. But what can they do about it, aside from singing? There is no concrete evidence. Unless....</p>

                <h2>4. 42</h2>
                <p><i>"Those who are dead are not dead"</i> is the line Martin opens <i>42</i> with, a plaintive piano ballad musing on the meaning of life, complete with somber harmonies and strings. The band build this up gradually into a frenzy of noisy guitars and drums, before running away with the song entirely into a cheery pub singalong. Beautiful, but it doesn't really make sense alone, unless we look at it through the eyes of.... <br><br> Chris and his friends are back in the graveyard we saw earlier, in the opening montage. Wandering along the numerous headstones (for many have passed beyond) Chris ponders why all of this exists as it is. Also troubling him are those who are "<i>living in his head</i>", probably those who have gone missing under mysterious circumstances. This morbid pondering eventually breaks into comic mischief, because they are, after all, young. This fun is broken when they stumble through a section of the graveyard with many unmarked graves, answering Chris' question in the worst possible way.</p>

                <h2>5. Lovers in Japan</h2>
                <p>Quite possibly the most joyous song ever written, <i>Lovers in Japan</i> is a masterpiece of a song. Built around a honkytonk piano riff that Guy, Jonny, and Will spent hours pushing tacks into piano hammers to achieve, the song has incredible rhythm from Guy and Will, with the Buckland throwing in <i>three</i> guitar layers for good measure. This is bridled rage, kept in check by the perpetual joy that Coldplay seem to possess regardless of the circumstance <br><br> This controlled anger is what makes this song the rallying cry for our three heroes, bringing to the attention of the public the crimes and the failings of the king, while promising them a cause to fight for. It is also paired with the wistful <i>Reign of Love</i>, in which Chris describes the ideal world with comfort for all, where even the "<i>locusts will lift me up</i>". </p>

                <h2>6. Yes</h2>
                <p><i>Yes</i> is one of the strangest tracks in Coldplay's discography, and that's saying something. Mostly fuelled entirely by an intoxicating blend of strings, percussion, Jonny's guitar layers, and Guy's sublime bass (that punch in the chorus is just insanely satisfying), the song also changes from 4/4 to 3/4 quite a few times. Chris also ditches his usual falsetto for a far lower register, weirdly channeling some form of Muse energy into the song as a whole. The whole thing gets even stranger when halfway through the track, the song ends and <i>Chinese Sleep Chant</i> begins, a My Bloody Valentine inspired acid trip, that was supposedly written under hypnosis. <br><br> Skipping over a significant portion of time, we assume, our heroes have now set in motion a plot to wrest power from the tyrannical monarch. For this, a distraction is needed, so in an incredibly sexist turn of events Thom volunteers Violet to seduce the king. This succeeds, over time, and over <i>Chinese Sleep Chant</i> they raid the castle, disable the guards, and overthrow the king, bringing him to his people to atone for his crimes. </p>

                <h2>7. Viva La Vida</h2>
                <p>Possibly the most successful song Coldplay have ever released, (one of) the title track(s) is a lament evoking imagery of kingdoms and armies and glories lost, over a symphonic crescendo of strings, bells, and kettle drums. Theatrics and instrumentation aside, it is certainly strange that a song sung from the perspective of a dethroned monarch ended up as 2008's Song of the Summer, even going on to win Song of the Year at the following Grammy Awards, topping the Billboard 100 charts, and cementing its position as a crowd-favourite anthem in all their live shows. Accused multiple times of plagiarising various songs, revived by Minecraft, and inspiring various memes, the song is now iconic. <br> <br> This song is also the most straightforward in terms of storyline, in the sense that it is directly the tyrant king's lament, as sung by himself shortly after being deposed. You can even hear his dirge as he is carried off to his execution at the end of the song. </p>

                <h2>8. Violet Hill</h2>
                <p>The lead single off the album, <i>Violet Hill</i> is that rare thing, a cynical Coldplay song with no real resolution. Jonny features prominently here, I don't think any other song of theirs save Politik has him playing so angrily. Raging against all the injustice in the world, with digs at Fox News and false prophets, this is one slow rager of a song. The line <i>"When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show, you better lie low"</i> playing over <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8zKtcKCaG8">a montage of politicians dancing</a> is beautifully poignant.<br><br> After the tyrant is gone, everything should be hunky-dory, right? Wrong. As in every story of Love, Death, and Revolution, the usurper succumbs to the corruption of power. Chris, who had no political aspirations beyond bringing the king to justice, watches with growing alarm as Thom gets power drunk and starts declaring those he has personal vendettas against "Enemies of the Revolution" and summarily executing them. He finally executes Violet on trumped up charges after she rejects his romantic advances, throwing Chris in prison for trying to prevent it, which forces Chris to take matters into his own hands, killing Thom and finally establishing a democratic state.</p>

                <h2>9. Strawberry Swing</h2>
                <p>The final single to be released from the album, over a year later, <i>Strawberry Swing</i> is the antidote to Violet Hill, sweet and wistful where the latter is angry and caustic. Again built around one of Jonny's guitar riffs, Coldplay uses synths and layers to achieve this sort of hazy effect that's probably the musical equivalent of rose-tinted glasses. Guy probably has a significant role in the creation of this atmosphere. So good even Frank Ocean did a cover of it. <br><br> And in keeping with our story, this is Chris looking back at the time when he, Thom, and Violet were all just relatively innocent and carefree, and how he wishes that things hadn't come to this. "Without you it's a waste of time" could apply to either of his two best friends, consumed by their efforts to bring about some justice.</p>

                <h2>10. Death and All His Friends</h2>
                <p>The <i>other</i> title track, <i>Death and All His Friends</i> is one of the sweetest and most <i>Coldplay</i> Coldplay songs out there. Beginning with just Chris and a piano, Jonny comes in with a guitar lick that somehow moves you to tears with a single note, as he is apt to do. But then the whole song changes and becomes another rousing anthem, a spectacular way to close an album of this calibre. Complete with crashing drums, railing against the Title Characters, and wonderfully stacked layers of guitar, piano and bass, it winds down with the same sample we began this whole thing with. <br><br> And here is where we leave Chris, lying on his deathbed, looking back at life and what he made of it. Perhaps the world he leaves is better than the one he came into. Perhaps his accomplishments have all been eroded beven before he has passed on. But no matter. He cannot lie around becoming <i>"a cycle of recycled revenge"</i>. He will give into Death and go peacefully. That is, unless he has no other future Prospekts......</p>

            <p>Every Coldplay record has a little line saying that <i>"Coldplay are Guy Berryman, Jonny Buckland, Will Champion, and Chris Martin."</i> This is almost, but not quite, true. Coldplay has a little-known fifth member, Phil Harvey. On this page we look at all of these incredible individuals.</p>

                <h2>Chris Martin</h2>
                <p>Lead Vocalist, pianist, and the most disproportionately famous member of the band, Chris Martin consistently comes off as one of the nicest human beings on the planet. Constantly buzzing with energy according to all those who have ever interacted with him, he makes up about half of the band's public image. <br><br> On <i>Viva la Vida</i> he is all over the place, in the best way possible. From absolutely thumping out those chords on <i>Lovers in Japan</i>, to hitting some of his lowest notes on record on <i>Yes</i>, Chris pours his heart and soul into each and every track on this album. It is that attitude, combined with his wearing of his heart on his sleeve (metaphorically here, but also <a href="#heartonsleeve" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#heartonsleeve">literally later on</a>) that makes Coldplay who they are.</p>

                <h2>Guy Berryman</h2>
                <p>Car enthusiast, fashion designer, and bassist for Coldplay, Guy Berryman is commonly known as the most handsome member of the band. Often rather quiet and reserved in comparison with the other members, Guy is also possibly the member with the most side projects outside of Coldplay. Besides playing bass with the supergroup Apparatjik (who formed in 2008 as well to release the track <i>"Ferreting"</i>), in later years he co-founded the <i>Road Rat Magazine</i>, launched the fashion brand <i>Applied Art Forms</i>, and started the online catalogue <i>Dawghaus</i>.<br><br> On <i>Viva</i>, Guy was known for playing a Fender Jaguar Bass and taking lots of pictures while on tour on his Leica M7 35mm film camera. His signature work can be heard on songs like <i>Yes, Lovers In Japan</i>, along with some exceptional synth work on tracks such as <i>Life in Technicolor</i> and <i>Strawberry Swing</i>.</p>

            <div class = "track_text">
                <h2>Will Champion</h2>
                <p>In Chris Martin's words "the base of a statue, without which [the band] would topple", Will is the solid, dependable drummer of the band. Originally a multi-instrumentalist, he was cajoled into playing the drums for the band as the original drummer was a no-show. He has since made a cameo appearance (also as a drummer) in <i>Game of Thrones</i>, and received an honorary Doctrate in Music from the University of Southampton.<br><br> An absolute powerhouse of a musician, Will is most visible in concerts during the performance of the title track, which he plays while simultaneously standing up, ringing a bell, and singing the iconic "whoa oh oh oh oh oh" refrain. Will has established himself as one of the greatest drummers of all time, and evidence of this can be found right throughout the album, from the thunderous percussion on <i>Lost!</i> and <i>Death and All His Friends</i>, to the steady backbeats on <i>Lovers in Japan</i> and hidden track <i>Chinese Sleep Chant</i>.

            <div class = "track_text2">
                <h2>Jonny Buckland</h2>
                <p>Almost always seen with a smile, a Telecaster Thinline, and his signature cap, Jonny Buckland is the lead guitarist of Coldplay. The co-founder of the band with Martin (a term that means they just met each other before Will and Guy), Jonny is a wise, unassuming man who just happens to be an absolute genius guitarist, known for iconic riffs such as <i>Fix You</i> and <i>Charlie Brown</i> .<br><br> Jonny shines through <i>Viva</i> in every track on the record, while never overpowering or stealing the spotlight from the overarching plotline of the album. His stacked layers of sound on <i>Lovers in Japan</i> create a unique ambience, while <i>Death and All His Friends</i> and <i>42</i> have dizzying riffs from his <a href="#thinline" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#thinline">signature Telecaster Thinline</a> sprinkled all over. While playing live, he tends to recreate the string parts on his guitar as well, because that's what legends do.

                <h2>Phil Harvey</h2>
                <p>The secret fifth member of Coldplay, Phil Harvey has almost never been on stage with them during a concert. However, it is indisputable that without this wonderful human being, Coldplay would not be the band they are at this point in time. Originally their manager, and then their Creative Director from 2006, Phil Harvey has been involved in Coldplay from the beginning, as Chris and he were friends from school. <br><br> Returning to the band in 2006 after a hiatus taken due to the overwhelming pressure of Parachutes, Phil became a sounding board for all the creative output of the band. Despite not having a specific role within the band, his input has shaped Coldplay into the unstoppable force they are now.</p>
